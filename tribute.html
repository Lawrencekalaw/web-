                <li> <strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat ywice each <br>season, doubling wheat yields</li><br>
                <li><strong>1953</strong> - Crosses a short,sturdy dwar fbreed of wheat with a <br>high-yielding American breed, <br>creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer.It goes on to <br>provide 95% pf Mexico's wheat.</li><br>
